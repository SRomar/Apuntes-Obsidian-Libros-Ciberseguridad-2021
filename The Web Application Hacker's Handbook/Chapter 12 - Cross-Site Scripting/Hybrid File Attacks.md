One example of a hybrid file is a GIFAR file, devised by Billy Rios. A 	GIFAR file contains data in both GIF image format and JAR format and is actually a valid instance of both formats.

The attacker finds an application function in which GIF files can be uploaded, so he can construct a GIFAR file containing Java code that hijacks the session of any user who executes it.
