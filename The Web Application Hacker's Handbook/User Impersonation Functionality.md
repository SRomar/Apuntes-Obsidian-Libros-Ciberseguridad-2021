When carrying out password-guessing attacks, review **whether any users appear to have more than one valid password**, or whether a specific password has been matched against several usernames. Also, log in as many different user with the credentials captured in a brute-force attack, and review whether everything appears normal. Pay close attention to any "logged in as X" status message.
