Involves the attacker's web page loading the target application within an iframe on the attacker;s page. In effect, the attacker overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. The attacker's interface contains content to entice the user and induce him to perform action such as clicking the mouse in a particular region of the page.
