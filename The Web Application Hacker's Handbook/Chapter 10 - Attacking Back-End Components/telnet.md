Telnet is a protocol that provides a command line interface for communication with a remote device or server, sometimes employed for remote management but also for initial device setup like network hardware. Telnet stands for Teletype Network, but it can also be used as a verb; 'to telnet' is to establish a connection using the Telnet protocol.

Telnet provides users with a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication system utilizing a virtual terminal connection over 8 byte. User data is interspersed in-band with telnet control information over the transmission control protocol (**TCP**). Often, Telnet was used on a terminal to execute functions remotely.

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering Telnet into a command prompt by following this syntax: telnet hostname port. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands into the Telnet prompt. To end a session and log off, the user ends a Telnet command with Telnet.
