SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a [[TCP-IP]] protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail. However, since it is limited in its ability to queue messages at the receiving end, it is usually used with one of two other protocols, [[POP3]] (Post Office Protocol) or [[IMAP]] (Internet Message Access Protocol), that let the user save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically from the server. In other words, users typically use a program that uses SMTP for sending e-mail and either POP3 or IMAP for receiving e-mail.
