If you have access to the web application, do the following:
1. Use a suitable tool to monitor all filesystem activity on the server. For example, the [Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) tools from SysInternals can be used on the Windows platform, the ltrace/strace tools can be used on Linux, and the truss command can be used on Sun's Solaris.
2. Always try path traversal sequences using both forward slashes and backslashes.
3. You can use illegal Unicode payload type within Burp intruder to generate a huge number of alternate representations of any given character and submit this at the relevant place within your target parameter.
