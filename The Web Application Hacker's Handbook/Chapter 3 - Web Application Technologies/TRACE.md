Not too surprising, this can be substantially misused, such as the classic [Cross-Site Tracing (XST)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross_Site_Tracing) attack, wherein an XSS vector can be utilized to retrieve HttpOnly cookies, authorization headers, and such. This should _definitely_ be disabled.

The TRACE method, while apparently harmless, can be successfully leveraged in some scenarios to steal legitimate users’ credentials. This attack technique was discovered by Jeremiah Grossman in 2003, in an attempt to bypass the [HttpOnly](https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly) tag that Microsoft introduced in Internet Explorer 6 sp1 to protect cookies from being accessed by JavaScript. As a matter of fact, one of the most recurring attack patterns in Cross Site Scripting is to access the document.cookie object and send it to a web server controlled by the attacker so that they can hijack the victim’s session. Tagging a cookie as [HttpOnly](https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly) forbids JavaScript to access it, protecting it from being sent to a third party. However, the TRACE method can be used to bypass this protection and access the cookie even in this scenario.
