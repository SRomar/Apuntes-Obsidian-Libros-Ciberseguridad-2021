Also known as distributed computing and distributed databases, a distributed system is a ** collection of independent components located on different machines that share messages with each other in order to achieve common goals.**

As such, the distributed system will appear as if it is one interface or computer to the end-user. The hope is that together, the system can maximize resources and information while preventing failures, as if one system fails, it won't affect the availability of the service.

-   **Resource sharing** \- whether itâ€™s the hardware, software or data that can be shared
-   **Openness** \- how open is the software designed to be developed and shared with each other
-   **Concurrency** \- multiple machines can process the same function at the same time
-   **Scalability** \- how do the computing and processing capabilities multiply when extended to many machines
-   **Fault tolerance** \- how easy and quickly can failures in parts of the system be detected and recovered
-   **Transparency** \- how much access does one node have to locate and communicate with other nodes in the system.
