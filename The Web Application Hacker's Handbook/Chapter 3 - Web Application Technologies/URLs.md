### Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

The URL used to generate a HTTP request is as follows:

**protocol**://**hostname**:**port**/**path**/file?**param=value**

*You may encounter the term **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) being used instead of URL, but it is really only used in formal specifications and **by those who want to exhibit their pedantry** *

### **[[REST]]**
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of architecture for [[Distributed Systems]] in which requests and responses contain representations of the current state of the system's resources.
