Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) is a [cryptographic hash algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cryptographic-hash-algorithm "Learn more about Cryptographic Hash Algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that can be used to create a 128-bit string value from an arbitrary length string. Although** there has been insecurities identified with MD5**, it is still widely used. MD5 is most commonly used to verify the integrity of files. However, it is also used in other security protocols and applications such as SSH, SSL, and IPSec. Some applications strengthen the MD5 algorithm by adding a salt value to the plaintext or by applying the hash function multiple times.
