SSL (secure sockets layer) is a cryptographic protocol that facilities secure, encrypted connections on the Internet. The most well-known use of SSL is web browsers connecting to websites, where SSL is used on top of HTTP to create a HTTPS connection.

The SSL protocol actually began being phased out back in 1999. It was replaced by a newer, more secure protocol â€” the [[TLS]] protocol.
