1. If self-registration is possible, attempt to **register the same username twice with different password.**
2. If the application blocks the second registration attempt, **you can exploit this behavior to enumerate existing usernames** even if this is not possible on the main login page or elsewhere. Make multiple registration attempts with a list of common usernames to identify the already registered names that the application blocks.
3. If the registration of duplicate usernames succeeds, attempt to register the same username twice with the same passwords, and determine the application's behavior:
	1. If an **error message** results, **you can exploit this behavior to carry out a brute-force attack**, even if this not possible on the main login page. Target an enumerated or guessed username, and attempt to register this username multiple times with a list of common passwords. When the application **rejects a specific password, you have probably found the existing password for the targeted account.**
	2. If no error message result, log in using the credentials you specified, and see what happens. **You may need to register several users, whether this behavior can be used to gain unauthorized access to other users accounts.**
