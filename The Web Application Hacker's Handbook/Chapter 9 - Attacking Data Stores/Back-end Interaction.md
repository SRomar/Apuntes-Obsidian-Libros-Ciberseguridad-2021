One way of confirming that the application is interacting with a back-end database is to submit the SQL wildcard character **%** in a given parameter. For example, submitting this in a search field often returns a large number of results, indicating that the input  is being passed into a SQL query. Of course, this does not necessarily indicate that the application is vulnerable -only that you should probe further to identify any actual flaws.
