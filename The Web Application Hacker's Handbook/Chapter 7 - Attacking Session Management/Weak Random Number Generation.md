Sometimes when tokens are created based on the output of a pseudorandom number generator, developers decide to construct each token by concatenating several sequential outputs from the generator, this may enable him to infer some information about its internal state. In fact, it may be easier for the attacker to extrapolate the generator's sequence of outputs, either forward or backward.
