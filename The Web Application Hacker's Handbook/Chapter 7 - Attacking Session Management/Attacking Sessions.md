1. The application may often employ several different items of data collectively as a token, including cookies, URL parameters, and hidden form fields. Some of these may be used to maintain session state on different back-end components. **Do not assume that a particular parameter is the session token without proving it, or that sessions are being tracked using only one item.**
2. Sometimes, **items that appear to be the applications's session token may not be**. In particular, the standard session cookie generated by the web server or application platform may be present but not actually used by the application.
3. Often, new session tokens are created after a user authenticates herself. Observe which **new items** are passed to the browser after authentication.
4. To verify which items are actually being employed as tokes, **find a page that is definitely session-dependent ** (such as a user-specific "my details" page). Make several requests for it, systematically removing each item that you suspect is being used as a token.** If removing an item causes the session-dependent page no to be returned, this may confirm that the item is a session token.**
